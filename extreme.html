<h1>Extreme Verbal Arithmetic</h1>

<p>Every puzzle-lover has toyed with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verbal_arithmetic">verbal arithmetic</a>:</p>

<pre>SEND + MORE = MONEY</pre>

<p>This verbal equation is arithmetically satisfied by these substitutions:</p>

<pre>
{'O':0, 'M':1, 'Y':2, 'E':5, 'N':6, 'D':7, 'R':8, 'S':9}
</pre>

<p>which results in this numeric equation:</p>

<pre>
9567 + 1085 = 10652
</pre>

<p>But that's too easy. So let's play extreme verbal arithmetic.</p>

<p>Rather than just representing digits, the letters can also represent the arithmetic operators +, -, *, and /.</p>

<p>The goal is to find the extreme solution, the one that equates to the
largest value. For example:</p>

<pre>HI = FLY</pre>

<p>There are many solutions:</p>

<pre>
13 = 9+4
15 = 8+7
16 = 8*2
21 = 7*3
</pre>

<p>But what is the extreme solution?</p>

<p>The largest possible value for HI is 98. But there is no FLY expression that
evaluates to 98. (Prove it to yourself.) So how about 97? 96? 95? Nope, FLY
has too few letters for their factors. Oh! How about 81 = 9*9? Sorry, FLY
can't be 9*9 since F and Y are not allowed to be both be 9. Nothing works
until you get to the extreme solution of 72:</p>

<pre>
72 = 9*8
</pre>

<p>NOTE that the characters ** are the exponential operator. For example:</p>

<pre>
MOON = MEAT
3**4 = 3+78 = 81
</pre>

<p>Note also that in Python, numbers starting with a zero digit are base-8: 0123 == 83,
and that both / and // are division operators.</p>

<p>You may find the solutions to <a href="http://puzzles.bostonpython.com/hotdate.html">this puzzle</a> helpful.</p>

<p>Find the extreme solution for the following equations. </p>

<p>1.  TON = NOT</p>

<p>2.  SNAP = PEA</p>

<p>3.  EMAIL = SPAM</p>

<p>4.  MASSACHUSETTS = MA</p>

<p>5.  NOON = TUTORIAL</p>

<p>6.  WOMAN = MAN = NOW</p>

<p>7.  ABBABBA = A</p>

<p>8.  PYTHONIC = HYPNOTIC</p>

<p>9.  CAMBRIDGE = CODERS</p>
