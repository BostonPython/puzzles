<h1>A is for Anaconda</h1>

<p>Alphabetizing isn't just useful. It's fun!</p>

<p>Every kid learns that A is for Apple ... and Z is for Zebra.</p>

</p>But not every kid learns the mirror-alphabet words:</p>

<pre>
A is for Anaconda
B is for Bathtub
C is for Comic
...
Z is for Zizz
</pre>

<p>Not only are the first letters of each word alphabetic, so are the last
letters!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you can't complete this list: no word in English begins and
ends with X.</p>

<p>But what if you shift the alphabet by one letter for the ending?</p>

<pre>
A is for Absorb
B is for Byronic
C is for Caryatid
...
X is for Xenophoby
Y is for Yez
Z is for Zebra
</pre>

<p>You'll find that this won't work either. How about shifting the end letter
alphabet by 2?</p>

<pre>
A is for Antihemorrhagic
B is for Blindfold
C is for Capstone
...
Y is for Yoga
Z is for Zimb
</pre>

<p>That fails, too! In fact, there is only one mirror-alphabetic ordering that
works for English.</p>

<p>1)  Write a program that generates a valid mirror-alphabet word list.</p>

<p>2)  What is the one word that always sticks out like a sore thumb in your
mirror-alphabet list if you try to limit the list to 4-letter words? (Hint:
It's a style of handwriting.)</p>

<p>BONUS:  Make a mirror-alphabet word list that has the least weird words.
