<h1>Phone Numbers</h1>

<p>Long, long ago, people used to memorize phone numbers. To help people do
this, telephone keypads included letters. Here is a typical encoding:</p>

<pre>
        1       2       3
               abc     def

        4       5       6
       ghi     jkl     mno

        7       8       9
       pqrs    tuv     wxyz

        *       0       #
                +
</pre>

<p>1. Write a program that generates Boston vanity telephone numbers
(1-617-XXX-XXXX), where XXX-XXXX encodes a person's name.</p>

<p>For example, the vanity number for 'Adriana' would be 1-617-237-4262, which
is 1-617-ADRIANA.</p>

<p>But what to do with names longer or shorter than 7 letters? If a name is
shorter, then the vanity number will begin with a padding of 7's. For example,
the vanity number for 'Adam' would be 1-617-777-2326, which is 1-617-777-ADAM.
If a name is longer than 7 letters, then the vanity number will drop all
interior vowels starting from the end. For example, the vanity number for
'Elizabeth' would be 1-617-354-9284 (for 1-617-ELIZBTH). And for crazy long
names, you just take the first 4 letters and the last 3. For example,
'Mahershalalhashbaz' (yes that's a real name) would be 1-617-624-3229 (for
1-617-MAHEBAZ).</p>

<p>2. Now write a program that does the reverse, taking a vanity telephone
number and revealing the name. Impossible, you say? Not quite.</p>

<p>You could at least encode the first 3 letters of a name. A simple system for
achieving this would convert the old keypad number-letter mapping into a list
of tuples like this:</p>

<pre>
ADR = [(2,0), (3,0), (7,2)]
</pre>

<p>The first numbers of each tuple is the keypad number, and the second is the
index of the correct letter under the keypad number.</p>

<p>But that system only uses 6 of your 7 telephone digits (wasting entropy),
and can't we do better than a 3-letter name encoding? (Hint: yes we can,
<a href="phonenumbers_cipher.html">here's one way</a>.)</p>
