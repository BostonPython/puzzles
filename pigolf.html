<h1>Pi-Golf</h1>

<p>Mystery of mysteries, icon of geekdom... the irrational number pi.  Is it a
secret code, a message from the universe?  Let's find out.</p>

<p>Convert the digits of pi into uppercase ASCII letters.</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the first 3-letter English word in pi? (Hint:  The word 'OLD' appears at digit 1807, and it is not the first one.</li>
<li>What is the first 4-letter word? (Hint: it's a weird part of a bird!)</li>
<li>What is the first 5-letter word? (Hint: 'VIRUS' is at 3056055 and it's not the first.)</li>
<li>6-letter word? (It is suuuuch a good word! Hint: Google would have chosen it if somehow they controlled the universe itself which they don't, do they?)</li>
<li>7-letter word...?  This is an open question.  I have not found it yet!</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find millions of digits of pi online, but I also have txt files of
pi up to a billion digits.</p>
