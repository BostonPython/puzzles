<h1>Solutions</h1>

<p>A number of puzzles have member-contributed solutions linked at the end.
If you would like to do the same, you have two options:</p>

<p>1. Send an email to ned@nedbatchelder.com with your solution.</p>

<p>2. <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request">Make a pull request</a>
against <a href="https://github.com/BostonPython/puzzles">this repo</a>.  Make a directory
named after yourself in the "solutions" directory.  For example it might be the "solutions/pat" directory.
Put you solution in that directory, for example, "solutions/pat/blockparty.py".  The exact filename
doesn't matter, but it needs to be meaningful so you can make a link.</p>

<p>Then add a link to the end of the appropriate puzzle page.  The general form
of the link is:</p>

<pre>
https://github.com/BostonPython/puzzles/blob/gh-pages/solutions/YOURNAME/YOURFILE.py
</pre>

<p>for example,</p>

<pre>
https://github.com/BostonPython/puzzles/blob/gh-pages/solutions/pat/blockparty.py
</pre>


<p>You have to put the link at the bottom of the page with some HTML around it,
like this:</p>

<pre>
&lt;h2&gt;Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pat Smiths's solution is &lt;a href="https://github.com/BostonPython/puzzles/blob/gh-pages/solutions/pat/blockparty.py"&gt;blockparty.py&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a solution you'd like to share see the &lt;a href="solutions.html"&gt;Solutions page&lt;/a&gt; for instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>

<p>Yes, this is a pain.  If you have a better idea, drop me a line at ned@nedbatchelder.com,
maybe we'll do it your way!</p>
