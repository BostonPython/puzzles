<h1>Redistribute the Wealth</h1>

<p>Some men sat in a circle, so that each had two neighbors. Each had a certain
number of coins. The first had one coin more than the second, who had one coin
more than the third, and so on. The first gave one coin to the second, who gave
two coins to the third, and so on around the circle, each giving one coin more
than he received, for as long as possible. There were then two neighbors, one
of whom had four times as much as the other. How many men were there? And how
many coins did the poorest man have at first, and how much richer did he
get?</p>

<p>You can solve this with algebra. But thatâ€™s hard! Why not let Python do the
work for you.</p>

<p><b>Bonus</b>: For which ratios are there multiple solutions to this
problem?</p>
